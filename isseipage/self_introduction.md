## My Life So Far

### Early Childhood

- Born as the eldest son. Compared to my rambunctious younger brother, I was relatively quiet and calm.
- During kindergarten and early elementary school, I was very shy and struggled to make friends. I was the type of child who would often cry when confronted by strong-willed girls.
- At age 10, I joined a local youth baseball team. This experience greatly shaped my personality.
- Initially, I enjoyed playing baseball, but after being on the team for a while, I started throwing tantrums about not wanting to go because I couldn't play on weekends and the practice was quite strict. However, my parents were strict and told me, "If you want to quit, you have to tell the coach yourself." At the time, I was too timid to say that to the coach, so I was dragged to practice crying every week.
- However, while being dragged to practice crying, with my parents' support, I gradually started practicing on my own, and began getting hits and seeing results in baseball.
- Through these success experiences, I developed the belief that "even without talent, if you work hard consistently, you will definitely grow and achieve results."
- Later, I took a break from the youth baseball team to prepare for middle school entrance exams. From there, intensive studying began.
- Even with studying, I wasn't a genius type, but through the "consistent effort" I developed in baseball, my grades improved dramatically in the final year. I ultimately passed the entrance exam for Shibuya Gakuen Makuhari Middle School, which was my top choice. Before the exam, my chances of passing were considered quite low, so this also became a confidence-building success experience.

### Student Years

- After entering middle school, my original shyness decreased significantly, and I was able to make friends smoothly from the start. I think this was because I gained confidence through accumulating success experiences.
- In middle and high school, I belonged to the handball team and served as vice-captain. It was a team with high potential, and we achieved good results in several tournaments, but we couldn't achieve the results we wanted in the final tournament, which left me with regret. Based on this regret, I decided to "challenge myself without limiting my possibilities" for university entrance exams and aimed to pass the University of Tokyo, Japan's No. 1 university.
- Even for university entrance exams, my original grades weren't high, but through my characteristic effort, I improved my grades. Although my chances of passing remained below 20% until the end, I ultimately passed the University of Tokyo with just 2 points above the minimum passing score. I learned the importance of not arbitrarily limiting my own possibilities.
- At university, I belonged to the lacrosse team and devoted most of my four years to the club. The first three years had many difficulties, but in the final year, I was able to score in important game situations and play key roles. We aimed for the national university championship, and in my final year, we lost by 1 point and missed the national title, which was very disappointing, but I had the feeling that I gave it my all, so I have no regrets. The teammates I fought alongside for these four years are still close friends and are treasures to me.

### Working Years

- During job hunting, I was attracted by the people working there and joined Recruit Co., Ltd. For the first three years, I worked in corporate sales for mid-career recruitment advertising. It was a company that allowed young employees to challenge various things, so I was able to try many things from the beginning, and although I made many mistakes, I was able to gain a lot of experience, which was very valuable.
- In my third year as a working professional, due to my background in sports and my desire to build teams while working in the HR field, I requested a transfer and moved to a management position for a cashless payment sales team.
- Initially, I enjoyed my work at the new position, but gradually the gap between what I wanted to do (Want) and what I had to do/what I could do (Must/Can) became large, and I developed symptoms similar to mild depression. However, there, I received encouraging words from my team members at the time, and although management work was originally my main responsibility, I changed my work style to actually engage in sales like the other members. After making this change, various aspects of my work started going well.
- While doing management work, I was also responsible for selecting sales targets and visualizing sales results, where I had the opportunity to work with data scientists. There, I learned for the first time how technology is actually used in business settings. Through this experience, I thought that to build my future career, leveraging my strengths (being good at studying and working consistently on things) by learning IT from scratch could broaden my career options, so I chose to pursue graduate school.

### Graduate School Era

- Currently, I am studying Computer Science at QUT, a graduate school in Brisbane, Australia.
- I haven't graduated yet, but even at this point, I think this choice to come to Brisbane is one of the best decisions I've made. Thanks to this choice, I think my values have broadened considerably, and above all, I feel that studying technology is very enjoyable.
- During graduate school, I started working as a freelance software developer. Balancing work and graduate school studies is challenging, but I also feel a sense of fulfillment.

### Future Outlook

- I plan to graduate from graduate school in December 2025, and after that, I'll receive a 2-year Graduate Visa, so I plan to look for work as an software developer in Australia during that time.
- After those 2 years, I want to think about my career again based on how I feel after actually working. However, I don't know when it will be, but in the future, I want to do something as my life work that contributes to strengthening Japan's national power as a Japanese person.
- Also, my partner is planning to quit her job in Japan and come to Australia from January 2026. From then on, I want to work hard together as a team, never losing our smiles.

## Hobbies

- Horse racing watching. I've been watching horse racing since I was 3 years old, and when I was little, I was taken to the racetrack every birthday. I love horse racing as a sports but gamble. I've loved jockey Katsuharu Tanaka since I was young. During my student years, I would check his blog every week to see last week's results and this week's scheduled horses' movements.
- Lacrosse. I belonged to the lacrosse team during university, and now I belong to the University of Queensland lacrosse team. In October 2024, I won as a Queensland state representative at the East Coast Cup.
- Boxing and kickboxing watching. Due to my experience doing kickboxing during my company days, I love watching boxing and kickboxing. I particularly like Naoya Inoue and Takeru. What I like about martial arts is how the amount of practice someone has accumulated and their determination and personality are strongly reflected in actual matches.

## Favorite Musicians

- I love the Japanese rock band Southern All Stars. I go to their concerts every year with friends. My particularly favorite song is "Eiko no Otoko" (Man of Glory). I love the flavorful lyrics by Keisuke Kuwata and the melodies played by all the Southern All Stars members.
- I love Mac Miller. I particularly love the songs he's been releasing since around 2016. I like his jazzy music and introspective lyrics. Every time I listen to his songs, I feel like crying. My particularly favorite song is "2009."
- I love Loyle Carner. I love his fashion and appearance. My particularly favorite song is "Lyin."
- I love Tom Misch. I think his guitar style, fashion, and singing style are very cool. My particularly favorite song is "It Runs Through Me."

## Favorite Foods

- I like hamburgers. Recently, the wagyu burger I had at O'Reilly's Canungra Valley Vineyards was absolutely delicious.
- I like eel. When I return to Japan, I always eat unagi don (eel rice bowl).

## Favorite Movies

- I like "Begin Again." I like John Carney's works, and I also like "Modern Love" on Amazon Prime.
- I like "The Butterfly Effect." I like fantasizing about what would have happened if I had changed my past choices at that time.
- I like "Wonder." I prefer happy ending movies over bad endings.

## Favorite Books

- I love Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning." It has shaped one of my life philosophies.
- I particularly like the part where it says, "Don't ask what meaning life has for you, but rather what meaning you can give to life by responding with all your might to the questions life asks of you, and discovering meaning through that process."

## Favorite Color

- I like maroon color. This is because it represents the state of Queensland.

## Favorite Words

- Steve Jobs' phrase "Connecting Dots."
- Rather than having some grand goal and walking through life, I have given my all to whatever was in front of me, which has changed the scenery I see, created new goals, and I've progressed through life hitting walls along the way. In that process, I feel that my past experiences (dots) connect, the lines within me grow larger, and the meaning of past experiences also changes because of this. I want to continue giving my all to what's in front of me while increasing my dots, so that the size of lines and surfaces within me grows larger.
- I also like the words by Hiromasa Ezoe, founder of Recruit Co., Ltd.: "Create opportunities for yourself and let those opportunities change you."
- Since moving to Australia, I have been fighting daily while cherishing the above words. From a state where I couldn't speak English well and had no experience as an software engineer, to build skills from scratch, I have created opportunities for myself, put myself in situations where I have no choice but to act and learn, and from there, I have worked hard to make the most of those opportunities. This spirit is a way of thinking I want to cherish no matter how old I get.

## Favorite Places

- Horse racing tracks. There, the drama of horses and people is packed. Also, the sight of horses running is very cool and beautiful.
- Hot springs in Hioki City, Kagoshima Prefecture. This is my hometown, and the quality of the hot springs here is the best.

## Future Dreams

- To become a horse owner. I have a friend who owns a large racehorse farm in Hokkaido, and my future dream is to purchase horses from that farm and win horse races.
- To live happily with my partner and family.
- I don't have a specific field preference, but I want to become an uncle who continues to challenge himself even as I age.

## Personality

- My StrengthsFinder results are "Restorative," "Achiever," and "Harmony."
- My 16 Personalities result is INTP (Logician)
- I can work on things consistently. I can't handle things skillfully, but I can work steadily on things one by one and achieve results. I'm a routine person, so the good point is that I can continue consistently, but sometimes I lack adaptability.
- I like studying and learning things. I have high intellectual curiosity.
- I'm the type who laughs often. In interpersonal communication, I have strong harmony-seeking tendencies. However, I'm not actually very interested in people.

## Concerns/Worries

- Since childhood, I have a weak stomach, and when I eat a lot of food or drink alcohol, I immediately get diarrhea.
- Everyone in my family is bald, and I'm worried that I might start losing my hair at a young age too.
- Although I changed careers in my late 20s, I'm anxious about how to shape my career going forward.
